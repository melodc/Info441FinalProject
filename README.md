# Project Proposal

## Project Description 
<p> 
Currently there is no resource for UW students to see specific reviews and suggestions about a particular course. 
  Similar services, such as RateMyProfessor focuses on the professors themselves, while UW course evaluation only
  displays numerical ratings without much explanation for the course structure, details, or helpful suggestions. 
  As UW students and developers, we want to solve this issue by building an application to help UW students make 
  more informed decisions about the classes they want to take: by creating an application where they are able to 
  see reviews for a particular course and view the difficulty of the course, see the recommendations from other 
  students, and able to submit reviews/evaluations of a course anonymously.
</p>

## Technical Description
### Architectural diagram mapping 

User Client
Gateway layer
Authentication layer - verify student is UW student
Redis session store
mySQL database - information of all the evaluations/ratings of a course, information of students
Search microservice - search for evaluations based on major/number
Evaluation submission microservice - submit a form for evaluation of class

| P0 | As a student | I want to be able to Sign in and Sign up as user | Store log in credentials in database, authenticate user and store sessions inside Redis database. |
| P1 | As a student | I want to be able to update my evaluation | User clicks on edit button, updates the fields,  save evaluation updates in SQL database |
| P1 | As a student | I want to be able to update the information in my profile after sign up | Update the MySQL database, return a response displayed on the front-end |

## Data Models
 * **Evaluation**: The courses are evaluated and reviewed by students. The evaluations are specific to a course. A single course can have multiple evaluations based on the quarter, year and instructors involved. One user can submit only one evaluation per course. User will be able to edit and delete evaluations.

Evaluation: {
	ID: int
	studentID: int
  courseID: int
	instructors: string (multiple instructors can be included separated by ‘ , ’ or ‘ ; ‘) 
	year: date
	quarter : string
	creditType: string
	credits: int
	workload: int  (on a scale of 1-10)
	gradingTechniques: int
	description: string	
	LikedUsers: string[] ( list of unique userIds who have liked the evaluation. The length of the array provides count of likes. Need to check if the userId exists before adding to the list, to maintain unique userIds)
	DislikedUsers: string[] ( list of users who disliked the course) 
}

 * **Course**: The evaluations are specific to a course. This data model contains course information such as Course Title, Course Code, Credits and a brief Description text.

Course: {
	ID: int
	Title: string
	Code: string
	Description: string
	Credits: int
}

 * **Student**: represents student information

Student: {
	ID :  int64  
	Email:  string 
	PassHash: []byte 
	UserName: string 
	FirstName: string 
	LastName:  string 
	AvatarPhotoURL:  string 
}

 * **NewStudent**: represents new student information, used during user registration

NewStudent struct {
	Email: string 
	Password: string 
	PasswordConfirmed: string 
	UserName: string 
	FirstName: string 
	LastName: string 
}

 * **Student Credentials**: used during user login
Credentials: {
	Email: string 
	Password: string 
}
